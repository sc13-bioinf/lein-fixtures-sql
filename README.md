# fixtures-sql

A Leiningen plugin to generate sql fixtures from your production database.

## Usage

Put `[fixtures-sql "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
fixtures-sql 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

lein fixtures-sql

This plugin will run automatically based on a supplied properties file.
You can specify this like so:
````bash
lein fixtures-sql --config fixtures-sql.properties
````

By default it will try to load resources/fixtures-sql.properties.

This properties file should contain the connection details for read-only users of your target databases.
(i.e. development or production)
The sql fixtures generated by this plugin can then be applied when testing your project.
The format of the properties file is as follows:

````
myproject.db.classname   = org.postgresql.Driver
myproject.db.subprotocol = postgresql
myproject.db.subname     = //test.google.com:3000/myproject\_dev
myproject.db.user        = userone
myproject.db.password    = mysecurepassword
````
